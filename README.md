# Trading Platform

## _using MERN Stack and Finnhub API_

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

This trading platform is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and uses the Finnhub API to gather stock market data. The application consists of a backend and a frontend, which are deployed separately. The backend is deployed on Render, and the frontend is deployed on Netlify. The application has three pages: login, signup, and the main page. Firebase is used for authentication.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React Js](https://reactjs.org/) -framework used for the FrontEnd
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - The awesome database used
- [FinnHub API](https://finnhub.io/) - API used to gather stock market data
- [FireBase](https://firebase.google.com/) - The great authentication provider
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/) - the Web Service System.
- [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) - The hosting provider used for the frontend
- [TailWind] - duh :)

And of course TradingApp itself is open source with a [public repository]()
on GitHub.
